//! The heater module here represents components from 
//!
//! BT-11 to BT-12
//! This is because heater inlet and outlet temperatures are measured 
//! using BT-11 and BT-12
//! 
//! However, BT-11 is located before the heater bottom head 
//! and BT-12 is located after the static mixer MX-10 
//!
//! Hence, we have four sections,
//!
//! the heater top head, heater bottom head, heated section,
//! mixer MX-10 and the static mixer pipe attached to MX-10 modelled 
//! in the Relap and SAM model
//!
//! So there is not only some residence time, but also other mechanisms 
//! for parasitic heat loss 
//!
//! Dr Dane De Wet's transform model does callibrate for this using 
//! a heat transfer coefficient of 20 W/(m^2 K) instead of 6 W/(m^2 K)
//!
//!
//! I intend to connect structural supports to the heater top and bottom 
//! head and callibrate the length of those structural supports 
//! as part of model callibration such that the heater inlet is 
//! 80C approximately, and the heater outlet is 102.45 C 
//!
//! at nominal heater power of 8 kW
//!
//! For this, I also want to ensure that the code runs fast enough,
//! at least faster than real time, so it is suitable for digital 
//! twin applications
//!
