/// in this test, the DRACS loop with zero parasitic heat loss is

/// One with TCHX outlet temperature of 46 C 
/// Second with TCHX outlet temperature of 40 C
/// Third with TCHX outlet temperature of 35 C
///
/// These are enforced as part of the boundary conditions of the TCHX

/// Lab.(ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

/// I found it hard to distinguish what TCHX temperatures case A,
/// B and C were.
///
/// But there was another publication which shows which is test group 
/// corresponds to which temperature:
///
/// Zou, L., Hu, G., O'Grady, D., & Hu, R. (2021). Code validation of 
/// SAM using natural-circulation experimental data from the compact 
/// integral effects test (CIET) facility. 
/// Nuclear Engineering and Design, 377, 111144.

/// According to table 2,
///
/// Case A has 7 tests and TCHX out temperature of 46 C
/// Case B has 9 tests and TCHX out temperature of 35 C
/// Case C has 9 tests and TCHX out temperature of 40 C
///
/// Table 3 also provides the data for these tests. These are included 
/// in the module
///
/// For this set of tests, we do not worry about real-time calculations 
/// just yet
