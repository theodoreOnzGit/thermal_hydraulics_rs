    // honestly, I am quite unsure as to how to structure the 
    //
    // fluid mechanics and thermal hydraulics calculations.
    // 
    //
    // there are several ways we can do this... 
    //
    //
    // We could first manage one component at a time, and manually 
    // sum up the pressure drop contributions of each component as well 
    // as manually update each of the component temperatures
    //
    // This, however, is a very cumbersome way to coding. It is extremely 
    // error prone.
    //
    // To abstract away some of this, we could have individual heat 
    // transfer entities, and at each timestep, clone their relevant fluid 
    // arrays into a FluidComponentCollection. These FluidComponentCollections 
    // can then be arranged into a FluidComponentSuperCollection
    // and then the relevant fluid mechanics calculations could be 
    // performed.
    //
    // The heat transfer entities would then have their 
    // mass flowrates sorted out manually at each timestep.
    //
    // The most abstract way would be to couple all components into a 
    // collection. However, given that each component has multiple 
    // heat transfer entities in it, this may not be the best way to do 
    // things.
    //
    // For now, let's opt for way two, where we have HeatTransferEntity 
    // objects converted into FluidComponent objects, and then arranged 
    // into arrays.
    //
    // HeatTransferEntity objects are usually in the pre_built_components 
    // section. So I won't test them here.
    // However, these can be converted into FluidComponent objects.
    // So we'll just work with fluid component objects for now.
