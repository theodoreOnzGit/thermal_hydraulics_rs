/// Example 1: 
///
/// This example shows how to create a simple pipe
/// using the FluidComponent and FluidPipeCalcPressureLoss,
/// traits
///
/// this is by no means the best way to do it, but its a start
/// remember to use the relevant imports in the fluid component
/// tests
///
/// it is made of copper, 1m long, 2 in in diameter
///
/// This does not take inclined angles into consideration yet
pub mod air_pipe_example;


/// Example 2:
///
/// We saw previously how to create an air pipe
/// now we shall make a slanted water pipe
/// with some internal pressure source (as if it had a pump attached
/// to it)
///
/// we shall improve on how we can create the pipes
/// to do so, we shall use the FluidComponent trait and the 
/// FluidPipeCalcPressureChange trait
///
pub mod water_pipe_example;

/// Example 3,
/// 
/// suppose now we have a coriolis flowmeter
/// with a custom friction factor correlation
///
/// (f_darcy L/D + K) = 18 + 93000/Re^1.35
///
/// we shall use water to push flow through this coriolis flowmeter
///
/// also, the programming is rather tedious
/// because of lifetimes, but this is one example of how it can be done
pub mod coriolis_flowmeter_example;

/// Example 4 
///
///
/// Testing if fluid component structs can be put into threads with move closures
pub mod concurrency_and_multithreading_example;

/// Example 5 
///
/// fluid components in series 
pub mod collection_fluid_components_in_series;

/// Example 6
///
/// fluid components in parallel 
pub mod collection_fluid_components_in_parallel;

/// Example 7
///
/// a colletion of fluid component collections is known 
/// as a super collection. 
///
/// for example, we have three branches of fluid components connected 
/// in series 
/// They are in turn connected in parallel for CIET. 
/// To facilitate calculations here, we have super collections
pub mod super_collection_fluid_components_in_parallel;
