//! A Library which contains useful traits and methods for thermal 
//! hydraulics calculations.
//!
//!
//! This crate has heavy reliance on units of measure (uom) released under 
//! Apache 2.0 license. So you'll need to get used to unit safe calculations
//! with uom as well.
//!
//!
//! This library was initially developed for 
//! use in my PhD thesis under supervision 
//! of Professor Per F. Peterson. It a thermal hydraulics
//! library in Rust that is released under the GNU General Public License
//! v 3.0. This is partly due to the fact that some of the libraries 
//! inherit from GeN-Foam and OpenFOAM, both licensed under GNU General
//! Public License v3.0.
//!
//! As such, the entire library is released under GNU GPL v3.0. It is a strong 
//! copyleft license which means you cannot use it in proprietary software.
//!
//!
//! License
//!    This is a thermal hydraulics library written 
//!    in rust meant to help with the
//!    fluid mechanics and heat transfer aspects of the calculations
//!    for the Compact Integral Effects Tests (CIET) and hopefully 
//!    Gen IV Reactors such as the Fluoride Salt cooled High Temperature 
//!    Reactor (FHR)
